# SQR Language Support for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides syntax highlighting and code snippets for the 
[SQR Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQR).

Special thanks to Gary Pullis for creating the [Sublime Text definition files](https://github.com/gpullis/SublimeText-PeopleSoft_SQR) 
upon which this extension was originally based.

## Current Features

Syntax highlighting and snippets.

## Roadmap

Intellisense? It might be a bridge too far, but it would be great to be able to type "do " and get
a list of available procedures that can be called, or type "{" and get a choice of constants.
