# SQR Language Support for Visual Studio Code

This extension provides syntax highlighting and code snippets for the 
[SQR Programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQR).

Special thanks to Gary Pullis for creating the [Sublime Text definition files](https://github.com/gpullis/SublimeText-PeopleSoft_SQR) 
upon which this extension was originally based.

## Current Features

Syntax highlighting and code snippets.

## Known Issues
1. Not all built-in SQR functions are included in syntax highlighting.
2. I've opened an [issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/5355) with VS Code for inconsistencies in the use of \t in snippets.
